    This is a base implementation of Payment concept.
    Payments are results of Payable.pay method execution.

    As such, for every payable concept in system there should be at least one payment.

    Payments are usually specific to their payable object and provide a way for them
    to interact with user giving him some payment for every any tariff given to `pay` method.

    Payments provide explanations for customer about themselves using `explanation` property.

    There are two types of payments: enabled and disabled.
    Enabled payments must provide full stack of methods with appropriate implementation,
    while disabled payments should only provide explanation.

    Usual scenario of payment lifetime includes creation, selecting by customer,
    showing its explanation, checking if its enabled and executing when user decides to do so.
    `execute` and `check` methods are final methods in this sequence.
